serial port open fails and takes 100% cpu

I've downloaded the source code for obdgpslogger and compiled it on my 12.04 machine. 
http://icculus.org/obdgpslogger/
http://icculus.org/obdgpslogger/downloads/obdgpslogger-0.16.tar.gz

Everything compiles fine, but when I run the obdgpslogger I have two problems when I run the program with this command

./obdgpslogger -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -a 5 -i temp,map,rpm,vss,throttlepos,sparkadv

1. The program/computer doesn't communicate correctly witht the ELM chip. I keep on getting 'timeout' for all the calls to write to the serial and wait for a response. Looking at the source code shows that the program is not getting a response back from the chip when it sends a command to it. 

Opening serial port /dev/ttyUSB0, this can take a while
Timeout!
Timeout!
Timeout!
Timeout!
Timeout!
Timeout!
Successfully connected to serial port. Will log obd data
Successfully connected to gpsd. Will log gps data
Timeout!
Couldn't get obd bytes for cmd 00
GPS acquisition complete

But it isn't successfully connected to the serial port.

If I open putty and set it up with the correct settings than I can communicate with the chip manually.

Any ideas on why this isn't working?

2. While my computer is trying to communicate with the ELM chip, the obdgpslogger takes 100% of the cpu. 

Not sure where to start with this one to debug the problem. Any ideas??
Attached is the output of this command.

Can't open serial;max out cpu

Hi all, 

I'm having problems running the obdgpslogger that I compiled from source. When it gets to the openserial() function, it doesn't open the serial and maxes out the cpu. I suspect that this is a ubuntu 12.04 or hardware problem, so I posted on the ubuntu forums first.

All the details of my problem are there.
The problem sound sort of similar to this one.

Why won't it open the serial port correctly, and why does it max out my cpu??

Thanks in advance!

All the best,

Anthony G.
